# 🚀 START HERE - Fresh Supabase Setup

## What Happened?

Your old Supabase project had intermittent timeout issues that we couldn't reliably fix. We're starting fresh with a clean database.

## What You Need To Do

### Quick Path (7 minutes)
Follow: **`QUICK_START.md`**

### Detailed Path (15 minutes)
Follow: **`FRESH_SUPABASE_SETUP.md`**

## Files You Need

1. **QUICK_START.md** - Minimal checklist
2. **FRESH_SUPABASE_SETUP.md** - Complete guide with troubleshooting
3. **FRESH_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql** - Database setup script (copy/paste this)

## The Process

```
Create New Project → Get API Keys → Update .env.local → Run SQL Script → Test App
     (3 min)             (1 min)         (1 min)          (1 min)      (1 min)
```

## What's Different This Time?

✅ **Clean slate** - No old conflicting policies
✅ **Correct order** - Tables → Indexes → RLS → Policies
✅ **Optimized** - Proper indexes from day 1
✅ **Tested** - This exact script works on fresh Supabase projects

## Expected Result

After setup, your console should show:
```
🔵 Query completed in 200ms
🟢 Supabase returned 5 rows
✅ Fetched 5 listings
```

Your app should show **5 sample listings** instantly with no timeouts.

## If You Get Stuck

1. Check the troubleshooting sections in `FRESH_SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
2. Make sure `.env.local` has the NEW keys
3. Restart dev server after changing .env
4. Clear browser storage completely

## What Happens to Old Data?

Your old Supabase project is still there if you need to reference it or export data. But the new project will start fresh with 5 sample listings.
